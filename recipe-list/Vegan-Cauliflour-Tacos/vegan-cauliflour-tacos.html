            refried beans and silky Yum Yum sauce are all about one thing: big flavor!
        </h4>
        <p>
            Witness the magnificence of the taco—an exquisite medium for an array of mouthwatering creations. From the classic flavors of barbacoa with
            tomatillo salsa to the innovative fusions of Korean beef or Thai tofu, the taco embraces a world of culinary possibilities. Alex and I primarily
            follow a whole food plant-based diet, constantly seeking inventive methods to incorporate vegetables. The taco, with its versatile nature,
            becomes an unparalleled canvas for crafting extraordinary vegetable combinations, offering an explosion of flavors and textures. Among our
            latest discoveries, the Crispy Cauliflower Tacos have emerged as our cherished favorite.

            <li>2 cups red cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>2 limes (1 for the cabbage &amp; 1 to serve)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Yum Yum Sauce (use vegan mayo or substitute Spicy Chipotle Sauce)</li>

          </ul>

                <h6>Make Crispy Breaded Cauliflower</h6>
                <p>Follow the instructions to make the Crispy Breaded Cauliflower (about 40 minutes total). Use the remaining time to complete the steps below.</p>

                <p>If using purchased refried beans, taste and mix with ½ teaspoon cumin and/or a pinch or two of kosher salt. Alternatively, you can make our Supremely Simple Refried Black Beans, but for this recipe, we preferred using store-bought beans to focus on the cauliflower.</p>

                <h6>Prepare Cabbage</h6>
                <p>Thinly slice enough cabbage for 2 cups. Mix it with 2 tablespoons lime juice and a pinch or two of salt. Allow it to stand at room temperature until serving.</p>

                <p>Warm the tortillas or char them by placing them on grates above an open gas flame on medium heat for a few seconds per side, flipping with tongs, until they are slightly blackened and warm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
